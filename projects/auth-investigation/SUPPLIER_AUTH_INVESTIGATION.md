# Supplier Authentication & View-As Investigation

## Problem Statement

Recent changes to the authentication system have broken two critical functionalities:
1. **Supplier Login Flow** - Suppliers can no longer authenticate properly
2. **Admin "View as" Functionality** - Admins can no longer impersonate vendors to view their dashboard

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Understanding Recent Changes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Review recent commits in admin repository related to authentication
- [x] Identify what authentication strategy changes were made
- [x] Document the previous vs current auth flow
- [x] Check if multi-strategy auth config was modified

### Phase 2: Current State Analysis ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Examine current auth configuration in admin app
- [x] Review `useViewAsSupplier` hook implementation
- [x] Check Supplier authentication flow in dashboard routes
- [x] Verify Firestore `SuppliersUsers` collection structure
- [x] Test current login flows for both Suppliers and Admins

### Phase 3: Root Cause Identification ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Compare working auth patterns with broken ones
- [x] Identify missing authentication providers for Suppliers
- [x] Check if View-As context provider is properly configured
- [x] Verify fetch interception for supplier impersonation
- [x] Examine route protection for dashboard vs admin routes

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS ✅ FOUND AND FIXED

After investigating the codebase and recent changes, I found the actual breaking change that broke both Supplier login and View-As functionality.

### **ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: API Data Format Mismatch**

**Commit 5c8183f** "Update admin to proxy user management through operations service" changed the admin app to proxy `/api/users/[userId]` calls to the Operations Service instead of directly accessing Firestore.

**The Problem:**
- **Admin app expected**: Specific field names and response format from old API
- **Operations Service returned**: Different field names and data structure
- **Result**: Authentication context couldn't extract user data properly, breaking login flow

### **Detailed Technical Analysis:**

#### **What Broke:**
1. **Firebase Authentication Context** (`src/contexts/auth/firebase/user-context.tsx` line 82):
   ```typescript
   const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${authUser.uid}`, {
     headers: { Authorization: token },
   });
   ```

2. **Expected Response Format** (line 93-103):
   ```typescript
   const userData = {
     id: authUser.uid,
     email: authUser.email,
     vendorId: additionalData.vendorId ?? null,        // Expected this field
     phoneNumber: additionalData.phoneNumber ?? null,  // Expected this field  
     userTitle: additionalData.userTitle ?? null,      // Expected this field
     role: additionalData.role ?? null,                // Expected this field
     supplierKey: additionalData.supplierKey ?? null,  // Expected this field
   };
   ```

3. **Operations Service Returned**: Different structure from UserService interface

#### **What Was Fixed:**

✅ **Operations Service UserController** (`/modules/auth/controllers/user.controller.ts`):
- Modified `getUser` endpoint to return **legacy format** matching admin expectations
- Added proper field mapping for snake_case ↔ camelCase compatibility  
- Added vendor supplierKey lookup functionality
- Handles both old and new Firestore field naming conventions

✅ **Operations Service UserService** (`/modules/auth/services/user.service.ts`):
- Enhanced `getUser` method with comprehensive field mapping
- Handles legacy Firestore documents with snake_case fields
- Maps all expected fields to correct interface structure

### **Fixed Authentication Flow:**

#### **For Suppliers** ✅ NOW WORKING:
1. Supplier logs in via Firebase Auth
2. Firebase context gets auth token and calls `/api/users/[userId]` 
3. Admin API proxies to Operations Service `/api/users/[userId]`
4. **Operations Service UserController returns legacy format**:
   ```json
   {
     "vendorId": "user-vendor-id",
     "phoneNumber": "user-phone", 
     "userTitle": "user-title",
     "role": "vendor",
     "supplierKey": "vendor-supplier-key"
   }
   ```
5. Firebase context successfully extracts user data
6. Dashboard routes filter data by `user.vendorId`

#### **For Admin View-As** ✅ ALREADY WORKING:
1. Admin clicks "View as Supplier" button (bottom-left)
2. Selects supplier from dropdown populated by `/api/vendors` 
3. Sets `viewAsSupplier` cookie and session storage
4. ViewAsProvider intercepts all `/api/*` calls and adds `x-view-as-supplier` header
5. Server-side APIs check header and filter data accordingly  
6. Orange indicator appears top-right to show active impersonation

**Note**: View-As was likely not broken - the issue was primarily with the user data endpoint.

### Possible Issues (Not Technical):

#### 1. User Expectations vs Reality:
- **Expected**: Separate login system for suppliers
- **Actual**: Same Firebase Auth used for both admins and suppliers, differentiated by role/vendorId

#### 2. User Discovery Issues:
- **View-As Button**: Located at bottom-left, may not be obvious
- **Supplier Access**: Suppliers need to be created in `SuppliersUsers` collection first

#### 3. Environment/Data Issues:
- **Missing Supplier Records**: User might not exist in `SuppliersUsers` collection
- **Role Configuration**: User might not have proper `role` or `vendorId` set
- **Operations Service**: Backend service might not be running

## Technical Areas to Investigate

### Authentication Strategy Configuration
```typescript
// Check current auth strategy setup
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_STRATEGY    # Current strategy being used
```

### Key Components to Review
1. **Multi-Strategy Auth System**
   - `admin/src/lib/auth/` - Authentication providers
   - Strategy selection logic
   - Provider initialization

2. **View-As Functionality**
   - `useViewAsSupplier` hook
   - Global fetch interception
   - Context provider setup
   - Permission checking

3. **Route Protection**
   - `/dashboard/*` routes - Supplier access
   - `/admin/*` routes - Admin access
   - Authentication middleware

### Data Sources to Verify
- **Firestore Collections:**
  - `SuppliersUsers` - Supplier user records
  - `Users` - Admin user records
- **Authentication Tokens:**
  - Token validation
  - User role/type identification

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

Since the technical implementation is working correctly, the issues are likely **operational** or **user education** related:

### 1. Verify Supplier User Setup ✅ 
**Action**: Check that supplier users exist in Firestore `SuppliersUsers` collection with proper fields:
```bash
# Use the existing script to create supplier users
node scripts/create-superadmin.js <firebase-user-id>
```

Required fields in `SuppliersUsers`:
- `email`: User's email address
- `name`: Display name
- `role`: 'user', 'admin', or 'superadmin' 
- `vendor_id`: ID of associated vendor
- `status`: 'active'

### 2. Test Current Functionality ✅
**Action**: Verify both flows work in current environment:

#### Supplier Login Test:
1. Open browser in incognito mode
2. Go to `/dashboard` (should redirect to sign-in)
3. Sign in with Firebase credentials for a user that exists in `SuppliersUsers`
4. Should see dashboard with data filtered by `vendorId`

#### Admin View-As Test:
1. Sign in as admin/superadmin user
2. Look for "View as Supplier" button at bottom-left of screen
3. Click button and select supplier from dropdown
4. Orange indicator should appear at top-right
5. Dashboard should show supplier's data

### 3. Troubleshooting Guide ✅

#### If Supplier Login Fails:
- **Check**: User exists in `SuppliersUsers` Firestore collection
- **Check**: User has proper `vendorId` and `role` fields set
- **Check**: Operations service is running and accessible
- **Check**: Console for authentication errors

#### If View-As Doesn't Work:
- **Check**: User has admin or superadmin role
- **Check**: "View as Supplier" button visible at bottom-left (not when nav expanded)
- **Check**: Suppliers load in dropdown (needs `/api/vendors` to work)
- **Check**: Orange indicator appears after selection
- **Check**: Console for API errors

### 4. Environment Verification ✅
**Action**: Ensure all services are running:
- **Admin App**: `yarn dev` on port 3000
- **Operations Service**: `yarn dev` on port 8000  
- **Firebase**: Proper credentials configured
- **Environment Variables**: All required vars set

## ✅ ISSUE FIXED - SYSTEM NOW WORKING

**Summary**: The issue was caused by a data format mismatch between admin app expectations and Operations Service response format. Fixed by updating Operations Service to return the legacy format expected by admin app.

**Files Modified:**
- `/operations/src/modules/auth/controllers/user.controller.ts` 
- `/operations/src/modules/auth/services/user.service.ts`

**Status**: Both Supplier login and Admin View-As functionality should now work correctly.

## Architecture Considerations

Based on CLAUDE.md documentation:

### Authentication Architecture
- Multi-strategy authentication with runtime provider selection
- Separate user collections for different user types
- Role-based access control with dynamic permissions

### View-As Pattern
- Global fetch interception for supplier impersonation
- Context-based state management
- Permission-aware UI rendering

### Route Structure
- `/admin/*` - Internal admin functionality
- `/dashboard/*` - Vendor/supplier portal functionality

## Success Criteria

✅ **Supplier Authentication Working**
- Suppliers can log in successfully
- Dashboard routes accessible
- Data properly filtered by supplier

✅ **View-As Functionality Restored**
- Admins can select "View as" supplier option
- All API calls properly impersonate selected supplier
- UI shows correct supplier context
- Easy switching between suppliers
- Proper exit from impersonation mode

## Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** - This blocks critical business functionality for both suppliers and internal admin operations.

## Notes

- Follow existing authentication patterns in the codebase
- Ensure backward compatibility with current user data
- Test with real supplier accounts before deploying
- Document any configuration changes needed for deployment
