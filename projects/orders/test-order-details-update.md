# Order Details Page Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Display Shipping, Handling, and Other Costs**
- Updated the OrderDetailsContent component to calculate and display:
  - **Subtotal**: Sum of all line items (quantity Ã— supply price)
  - **Shipping**: Total from shipping_lines array
  - **Tax**: From total_tax field
  - **Discounts**: From total_discounts field (shown as negative)
  - **Total**: Final calculated amount

The cost breakdown is now displayed in the shipping address card with proper formatting and currency support.

### 2. **Test Order Marking Feature**
- Added ability to mark orders as test orders (admin-only feature)
- Added a toggle switch in the Timeline section that allows admins to:
  - Mark an order as a test order
  - Unmark a test order
  - See descriptive text explaining the purpose

### 3. **Visual Indicators**
- Test orders display a "TEST" badge next to the order number in the header
- The badge uses a warning color (orange/amber) to make it easily identifiable

### 4. **API Updates**
- Added new `markAsTest` action to the order API endpoint
- Added `isTestOrder` field to the Order type interface
- Implemented admin-only restriction for the test order feature
- Test order marking is allowed for orders in any status (not just "Created")

### 5. **Security**
- Only admin users can see and use the test order toggle
- Non-admin users attempting to mark orders as test via API will receive a 403 error
- All actions are logged to Slack for audit purposes
