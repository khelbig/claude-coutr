Customer
Multiple access scopes needed â€” refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
Requires access to protected customer data.
The Customer resource stores information about a shop's customers, such as their contact details, their order history, and whether they've agreed to receive email marketing.


The Customer resource also holds information on the status of a customer's account. Customers with accounts save time at checkout when they're logged in because they don't need to enter their contact information. You can use the Customer API to check whether a customer has an active account, and then invite them to create one if they don't.

For security reasons, the Customer resource doesn't store credit card information. Customers always need to enter this information at checkout.

In a shop's checkout settings, there are three options for customer accounts:

Accounts are disabled: Customers can't create accounts and can check out only as guests.
Accounts are optional: Customers have the choice of either signing into their account or checking out as a guest. Customers can create accounts for themselves, and the shop owner can create an account for a customer and then invite them by email to use it.
Accounts are required: Customers can't check out unless they're logged in, and the shop owner must create their accounts.
Caution: Only use this data if it is necessary for the intended app functionality. Shopify retains the ability to restrict access to API Access scopes for apps not requiring legitimate use of the associated data.

post
Creates an account activation URL for a customer

customerGenerateAccountActivationUrl
Requires customers access scope.
Generate an account activation URL for a customer whose account is not yet enabled. This is useful when you've imported a large number of customers and want to send them activation emails all at once. Using this approach, you'll need to generate and send the activation emails yourself.

The account activation URL generated by this endpoint is for one-time use and will expire after 30 days. If you make a new POST request to this endpoint, then a new URL will be generated. The new URL will be again valid for 30 days, but the previous URL will no longer be valid.
