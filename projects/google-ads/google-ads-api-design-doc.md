# Google Ads API Design Documentation - Coutr

## Company Name: Coutr Fashion Group

## Business Model
Coutr operates an e-commerce platform selling fashion and lifestyle products. We manage our own Google Ads campaigns to drive traffic to our online store. We only advertise for our own website and products - we do not manage ads for third parties or operate as an advertising agency.

## Tool Access/Use
Our internal tool will be used by:
- Marketing team members to monitor campaign performance
- Operations team to sync product availability with ad status
- Finance team to track advertising spend and ROAS

The tool will:
1. **Dashboard View**: Real-time performance metrics displayed in our admin portal
2. **Automated Sync**: Hourly synchronization between our inventory system and Google Ads
3. **Budget Management**: Automatic pausing of campaigns when daily budget limits are reached
4. **Performance Alerts**: Notifications when campaigns underperform or overspend

Access is restricted to authenticated employees only. No external parties will have access to the tool.

## Tool Design

### Data Flow
1. **API → Database**: Hourly sync pulls campaign metrics into PostgreSQL database
2. **Database → UI**: Admin dashboard reads from database (not direct API calls)
3. **Inventory → API**: Product availability updates trigger ad status changes
4. **Alerts → Team**: Automated notifications via email/Slack for critical events

### Key Features
- **Campaign Performance Dashboard**: View metrics at account, campaign, and ad group levels
- **Automated Inventory Sync**: Pause ads for out-of-stock products
- **Budget Monitoring**: Track daily spend vs. budget with projections
- **ROAS Optimization**: Identify and pause underperforming campaigns
- **Historical Reporting**: Generate performance reports for specified date ranges

## API Services Called

### Read Operations
- `GoogleAdsService` - Query campaign performance metrics
- `Customer` resource - Account-level performance data
- `Campaign` resource - Campaign settings and metrics
- `AdGroup` resource - Ad group performance
- `CampaignBudget` resource - Budget monitoring

### Write Operations (Limited)
- `CampaignService` - Pause/resume campaigns based on inventory
- `CampaignBudgetService` - Adjust budgets (with safety limits)
- `AdGroupAdService` - Pause ads for out-of-stock products

## Safety Measures
- **Read-only by default**: Most operations are reporting only
- **Budget caps**: Hard limits on automated budget changes
- **Manual approval**: Budget increases require human confirmation
- **Audit logging**: All API calls are logged for compliance
- **Rate limiting**: Respect API quotas and implement exponential backoff
